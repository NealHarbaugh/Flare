# Flare AI - Checkpoint Loader

The Flare AI - Checkpoint Loader is a component of the Flare AI project. It serves the purpose of continuing the training process if the model-building process encounters issues and cannot be completed. This checkpoint loader requires that the initial model-building process has already been started and the necessary materials used in model-building are available.


## Getting Started

Modifications the code needs in order to run are in the user input section at the top of the script. 


### Prerequisites

Before using the Flare Tribunal Builder - Checkpoint Loader, ensure that the initial model-building process for predicting post-wildfire forest conditions has been started. 


### Installation

Before using this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or call reticulate::install+python() from reticulate.
