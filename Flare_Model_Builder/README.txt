# Flare AI

This project aims to train AI models to predict the state of a forest after a wildfire has occurred. This project can work with both numerical and categorical data and is a valuable tool for assessing post-wildfire forest conditions.


## Getting Started

Modifications the code needs in order to run are in the user input section at the top of the script. 


### Prerequisites

Labeled data on forest conditions before and after a fire are needed in order to train the AI models. The more data provided, the better the model can perform. 
 

### Installation

Before using this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or call reticulate::install+python() from reticulate.
