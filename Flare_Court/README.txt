# Flare AI - Forest Condition Predictor


The Flare AI - Forest Condition Predictor is the final part of the Flare Tribunal Builder project. It enables the use of fully trained models to run predictions on other locations, forecasting what they would look like after a wildfire. To utilize this predictor effectively, you will need access to the fully trained models, as well as data that matches the training data.


## Getting Started

Modifications the code needs in order to run are in the user input section at the top of the script. 


### Prerequisites

Before using the Flare - Forest Condition Predictor, ensure you have the following:

- Fully trained AI models for predicting post-wildfire forest conditions. These models should be available and properly configured.
- Data that matches the training data used for the models. The predictor requires relevant input data to make predictions.
 

### Installation

Before using this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or call reticulate::install+python() from reticulate.
